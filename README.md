Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
This repository provides a machine learning-based solution for detecting credit card fraud using a variety of techniques and algorithms. Credit card fraud is a significant issue in the financial sector, and machine learning models offer a robust method for identifying fraudulent transactions.

Overview
Credit card fraud can lead to substantial financial losses for both individuals and financial institutions. Traditional rule-based systems have limitations in detecting evolving fraudulent activities. Machine learning models, on the other hand, can adapt and learn from new patterns, making them a powerful tool in fraud detection.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to implement various machine learning algorithms to accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions, enabling timely intervention to prevent financial loss.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling missing values, feature scaling, and normalization.
Model Development: Training and evaluation of various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
Evaluation Metrics: Using precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve to assess model performance.
Deployment: The best-performing model can be deployed to a production environment for real-time fraud detection.
Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebooks
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
GitHub
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains credit card transactions, including a mix of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. Due to confidentiality reasons, the dataset used here is synthetic, generated for research purposes while preserving the statistical properties of real transactions.

Results
The model developed in this project achieved high accuracy in identifying fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. The detailed results and performance metrics are available in the repository.
